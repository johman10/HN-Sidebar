# HN Sidebar
A friend of mine asked me about a simple sidebar for the HackerNews stories.
He was tired of opening two tabs for each story, a comments tab and the article itself.
That's why he asked me to make this.

This Safari extension add a little toggle in the top right corner on all the frontpage article pages from HackerNews.
When you click it you see the comments that are placed on HackerNews.
